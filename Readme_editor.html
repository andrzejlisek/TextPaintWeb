<body>

<h1>Text editor</h1>

<p>One of the main <strong>TextPaint</strong> features is text
editor. The editor differs from other plain-text editors:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Treats text file/screen as two-dimensional plane divided
        into cells, where single cell consists of one character,
        two colors (background and foreground) and single
        attribute set.</li>
    <li>Allows to draw primitive figures similarly as simple
        graphics applications.</li>
    <li>Supports ASCII (plain test) and ANSI (text with colors
        and attributes) files.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Functionality and interface</h1>

</ul>

<p>The status bar in <strong>state 4</strong> has different
layout, which is described in subchapter about <strong>state 4</strong>.</p>

<h1>Character and color selector</h1>

<p><strong>TextPaint</strong> has two similar selectors. In order
to enter into selector, press <strong>F9</strong> key and switch
between selectors by pressing <strong>F3</strong> key.</p>

<h2>Character selector</h2>

<p>In the <strong>state 3</strong> and <strong>state 4</strong>,
you can draw using selected character. The current drawing
character and character code is shown on the status bar when the
character is used to draw. In the <strong>state 1</strong>, <strong>state
2</strong> and <strong>state 3</strong>, if you insert space (in
mode <strong>H-block</strong> and <strong>V-block</strong> only),
the selected character will be inserted. You can invoke the
character selector in every state by pressing the <strong>F9</strong>
key.</p>

<p><img src="readme_pics/pic.jpg" alt="`editor/editor3.png"
width="256" height="256"></p>

<p>At the top of character table there will be display the
character hexadecimal code and character glyph. The code consists
of 4 or 5 digits. The plane 16 forces code length to be 6 digits,
but is used very rarely, so the two leading digits for plane 16
is replaced by <strong>G</strong> for get 5-digital code. The <strong>G</strong>
digit is outside of hexadecimal digit set and means 16. For
example, the <strong>G1234</strong> has the same meaning as <strong>101234</strong>.</p>

<p>The character selector can work in two states:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ordinary</strong> - Browse all characters. By
        default, browsing the pages is limited for containing
        visible characters, but the limit can be enabled and
        disabled by pressing <strong>Backspace</strong> key.</li>
    <li><strong>Favorite</strong> - The 256 places of favorite
        characters, 95 of them can be assigned to alphanumeric
        keys.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use the following keys while the character table is
shown:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Arrows</strong> - Select character on the current
        page. You can go beyond the current page range to switch
        the page.</li>
    <li><strong>Page Up</strong>, <strong>Page Down</strong> -
        Flip one page up or down (go ahead 256 characters).</li>
    <li><strong>Home</strong>, <strong>End</strong> - Flip 16
        pages up or down (go ahead 4096 characters).</li>
    <li><strong>F1</strong>, <strong>F2</strong> - Switch the
        plane (go ahead 65536 characters).</li>
    <li><strong>F3</strong> - Switch to color selector.</li>
    <li><strong>F4</strong> - Open the ANSI process and display
        parameters.</li>
    <li><strong>Insert</strong> - Switch between ordinary and
        favorite state:<ul>
            <li><strong>Ordinary</strong>: If the pinted
                character exists in favorite set, there will be
                pointed.</li>
            <li><strong>Favorite</strong>: There will be pointed
                the same character, which is pointed in favorite
                state.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong> - Go to character being under the
        cursor.</li>
    <li><strong>Backspace</strong>:<ul>
            <li><strong>Ordinary</strong>: Select character for
                save as favorite.</li>
            <li><strong>Favorite</strong>: Select character or
                put character on pointed place.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tab</strong> - Move character selector window
        from corner to corner. You can use this if the window
        covers some text or window is bigger than screen.</li>
    <li><strong>Escape</strong> - Close without changing selected
        character.</li>
    <li><strong>Enter</strong> - Change selected character and
        close.</li>
    <li><strong>Any alphanumeric key</strong>:<ul>
            <li><strong>Ordinary</strong>: Save pointed character
                as favorite under pressed key.</li>
            <li><strong>Favorite</strong>: Go to place assigned
                with pressed key.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Color selector</h2>

<p>You can turn character selector into color selector or turn
color selector into character chelector by pressing <strong>F3</strong>.
In color selector, you can select the color and input text mode.
The text and colors are treated as two independed layers, which
can be modifed simultaneously or separately.</p>

<p><img src="readme_pics/pic.jpg" alt="`editor/editor4.png"
width="256" height="256"></p>

        ANSI. Value 0 means automatic and will be updated after
        file load.</li>
    <li><strong>Home</strong>, <strong>End</strong> - Number of
        rows for ANSI file load. Use if file is loaded
        incorrectly, applicable when file is loaded as ANSI.
        Value 0 means automatic and will be updated after file
        load.</li>
    <li><strong>F1</strong> - Switch between CR character
        processing while loading ANSI file:<ul>
            <li><strong>0</strong> - Treat as CR character
                (default).</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> - Treat as CR+LF sequence.</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> - Ignore CR character.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>F2</strong> - Switch between LF character
        processing while loading ANSI file:<ul>
            <li><strong>0</strong> - Treat as LF character
                (default).</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> - Treat as CR+LF sequence.</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> - Ignore LF character.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>F3</strong> - Switch to character selector.</li>
    <li><strong>F4</strong> - Open the ANSI process and display
        parameters.</li>
    <li><strong>Insert</strong> - Switch between edit mode within
        three states:<ul>
            <li><strong>Text+color</strong> - Edit text and color
                simultaneously.</li>
            <li><strong>Text</strong> - Edit text only without
                color changing.</li>
            <li><strong>Color</strong> - Edit color only without
                text changing.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong> - Go to color and retrieve
        attributes being under the cursor.</li>
    <li><strong>Tab</strong> - Move color selector window from
        corner to corner. You can use this if the window covers
        some text or window is bigger than screen.</li>
    <li><strong>Escape</strong> - Close without changing selected
        color.</li>
    <li><strong>Enter</strong> - Change selected color and close.</li>
    <li><strong>Digit keys</strong> - Toggle attributes as

    </li>
</ul>

<p>You can change text without changing colors or colors without
changing the text. In order to do, switch to appropriate mode
using <strong>Insert</strong> key. The text and colors are
independed layes. Actually, the attributes are in the color layer
and may be treated as specific colors, other from background and
foreground.</p>

<h2>ANSI file loading</h2>

<p>Many ANSI files are prepared for specified number of columns,
in most cases for 80 columns and 24/25 rows with saving screen
scroll. If you set other number of columns, the file may be
loaded incorrectly. To correct this, enter into color selector,
change number of columns or rows using <strong>Page up</strong>, <strong>Page
down</strong>, <strong>Home</strong> or <strong>End</strong> keys
and press Enter key. Then, you have to reload file using <strong>F8</strong>
key.</p>

<p>If the ANSI file loaded is actually plain text file, the file
can contain different end-of-line character than expected. If the
file is loaded incorrectly, you can change parsing of CR (<strong>0Dh</strong>)
and LF (<strong>0Ah</strong>) character in color selector. You
can press <strong>F1</strong> or <strong>F2</strong> during color
selector to change way of the character processing, the current
state is diaplayed as two digits on the top of character
selector.</p>

<p>Example settings:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>00</strong> - Standard process of CR and LF
        characters, suitable for all ANSI files and text files
        using CR+LF like files created in DOS and Windows.</li>
    <li><strong>21</strong> - Use LF character as CR+LF (EOL),
        suitable for plain text files created on Unix and Linux,
        which uses LF as EOL.</li>
    <li><strong>12</strong> - Use CR character as CR+LF (EOL),
        suitable for plain text files created on systems, which
        uses CR as EOL.</li>
    <li><strong>11</strong> - Use every CR character and every LF
        character as EOL separately.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Work states</h1>

<p>The text editor works in one of 4 states, which you can swich
by pressing <strong>F1</strong>, <strong>F2</strong>, <strong>F3</strong>,
or <strong>F4</strong> key. In order to display help text about
keys available in the current state, press the same function key
again. For example, in order to get help about <strong>state 2</strong>,
press <strong>F2</strong> while application works in <strong>state
2</strong>.</p>

<h2>State 1 - Write text</h2>

<p>In the <strong>state 1</strong>, you can input alphanumeric
characters like in every standard text editor, but there are few
differences.</p>

<p>You can use the following functional keys:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Escape</strong> - Change writing direction.</li>
    <li><strong>Backspace</strong> - Move cursor in opposite
        direction (this not delete the char).</li>
    <li><strong>Insert</strong> - Insert line or character.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong> - Delete line or character.</li>
    <li><strong>Enter</strong> - Change Insert/Delete mode.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Undo and redo</h3>

<p>You can undo or redo writing, but the direct function not
exists. To undo or redo, you have to switch to <strong>state 3</strong>
or <strong>state 4</strong> by pressing <strong>F3</strong> or <strong>F4</strong>.
Then, you can undo or redo by pressing <strong>Z</strong> or <strong>X</strong>.
After undo or redo, you can return to <strong>state 1</strong> by
pressing <strong>F1</strong>.</p>

<h3>Insert and delete</h3>

<p>The <strong>Enter</strong>, <strong>Insert</strong> and <strong>Delete</strong>
keys has different function than standard text editor.</p>

<p>By pressing <strong>Enter</strong>, you can choose between
four insert/delete modes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>H-block</strong> - Insert or delete text inside
        one line, at right from the cursor - moves text
        horizontally.</li>
    <li><strong>V-block</strong> - Insert or delete text inside
        one column, below the cursor - moves text vertically.</li>
    <li><strong>H-line</strong> - Insert or delete columns -
        moves text horizontally.</li>
    <li><strong>V-line</strong> - Insert or delete rows - moves
        text vertically.</li>
    <li><strong>H-roll</strong> - Roll the text horizontally -
        combine of insertion and deletion by font width, works on
        the <strong>state 3</strong> only and when the rectangle
        width is greater than <strong>1</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>V-roll</strong> - Roll the text vertically -
        combine of insertion and deletion by font height, works
        on the <strong>state 3</strong> only and when the
        rectangle height is greater than <strong>1</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>State 2 - Write characters</h2>

<p><strong>State 2</strong> works exactly by the same way as <strong>state
1</strong> with one difference: If you press alphanumeric key,
there will be written favorite characters assignet to the keys
instead of ordinary characters. You can view and change the
assigment in character selector.</p>

<p>The state is most usable when you frequently write specified
characters, because you can write the character just by pressing
assigned key.</p>

    <li><strong>Space</strong> or <strong>Numpad 0</strong> -
        Write selected character.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Writing frame elements</h3>

<p>Apart from keys listed above, you can write frame elements
(corners, tees and crosses) using some letter keys and numpad
digits as in the following scheme:</p>

<pre>  T---Y---U         T         7---8---9         7
  |   |   |        / \        |   |   |        / \
  |   |   |       G   Y       |   |   |       4   8
  |   |   |      / \ / \      |   |   |      / \ / \
  G---H---J     B   H   U     4---5---6     1   5   9
  |   |   |      \ / \ /      |   |   |      \ / \ /
  |   |   |       N   J       |   |   |       2   6
  |   |   |        \ /        |   |   |        \ /
  B---N---M         M         1---2---3         3</pre>

<p>For example, the <strong>T</strong> key or <strong>Numpad 7</strong>
writes the upper left corner as shown above. The diamond shape is
treated as rectangle rotated clockwise by 45 degrees.</p>

<h3>Insert and delete</h3>

<p>The insert and delete function works by the same way as in <strong>state
1</strong> and <strong>state 2</strong>, but there is few
differences:</p>

<ul>
    <li>This function works only, when rectangle shape is
        selected.</li>
    <li>In <strong>H-block</strong> and <strong>H-line</strong>
        modes, the rectangle width determines number of inserted
        or deleted columns once.</li>
    <li>In <strong>V-block</strong> and <strong>V-line</strong>
        modes, the rectangle height determines number of inserted
        or deleted columns once.</li>
    <li>In <strong>H-block</strong> mode, there can be modified
        few rows according to rectangle height.</li>
    <li>In <strong>V-block</strong> mode, there can be modified
        few columns according to rectangle width.</li>
    <li>The <strong>H-roll</strong> and <strong>V-roll</strong>
        modes works in the <strong>state 3</strong> only and
        while the rectangle width (for <strong>H-roll</strong>)
        or the rectangle height (for <strong>V-roll</strong>) is
        greater then <strong>1</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Font size</h3>

<p><strong>State 3</strong> is the only state, which allows to
change font and cursor size, which will be applied for all
states. The font width and height can be adjusted separately,
between 1 and 32 cells. The cursor size represents the current
font size and the size is indicated on the status bar. The move
step is the same as current font width or height. To move cursor
over another distance, change the font size.</p>

<p>If you change font size whice the cursor is not at the first
line and the first column, it is possible, it is possible, that
the cursor distance from begining does not equal to multiply font
width or height. In such case, when you move the cursor left or
up, the first column or the first row will not reachable, because
the remaining distance is less than font size. Cursor position
above the first row or before the first column is not possible.</p>

<p>While the font width or height is greater than <strong>1</strong>,
the current character or color indicated on the status bar and
used in some operation is determined be the most number of cells
containing such character or color. If there are several
characters in the same number of cells within the cursor, the
first occurence will be used.</p>

<p>You can copy and paste the text preserving the font size only
when the font size is <strong>1x1</strong> while both copying and
pasting. When you copy or paste with other font size, the text
and color will be preserved. Otherwise, you can copy the text
written with the bigger font into the other software or paste the
text from the other software using desired font size.</p>

<h2>State 4 - Pixel drawing</h2>

<p>The <strong>state 4</strong> is purposed to draw pictures
using semigraphical characters splitted into pixels. Some
characters offers pixels by splitting for example to <strong>2x2</strong>
pixels per character. You can paint by character or by pixels as
defined in configuration file. In the state, there are two
cursors:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Main cursor</strong> - The cursor, which is moved
        by <strong>Arrow</strong> keys and <strong>Home</strong>/<strong>End</strong>/<strong>PageUp</strong>/<strong>PageDown</strong>
        keys. Pressing these keys causes movement of both
        cursors.</li>
    <li><strong>Size cursor</strong> - The second cursor, which
        is connected with main cursor. This cursor determines
        figure size for drawing lines, rectangles, ellipses, and
        copying/pasting picture.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="readme_pics/pic.jpg" alt="`editor/editor7.png"
width="256" height="256"></p>

<p>During <strong>state 4</strong>, there are following functions
by keys:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>W</strong>,<strong>S</strong>,<strong>A</strong>,<strong>D</strong>
        - Move size cursor.</li>
    <li><strong>I</strong>,<strong>K</strong>,<strong>J</strong>,<strong>L</strong>
        - Move picture between cursors.</li>
    <li><strong>1</strong> - Change paint configuration:<ul>
            <li>The first configuration uses one pixel per
                character and allows to select character for
                foreground and background in character selector.</li>
            <li>The other configurations may use several pixels
                per character. Every pixel configuration inside
                character is mapped to appropriate character.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>2</strong> - Change default color. This option
        defines, how will be treated characters other than
        characters used in current paint configuration.</li>
    <li><strong>3</strong> - Draw one pixel (in hollow mode) or
        flood fill (in fill mode).</li>
    <li><strong>4</strong> - Draw line between cursors.</li>
    <li><strong>5</strong> - Draw rectangle between cursors.</li>
    <li><strong>6</strong> - Draw ellipse between cursors.</li>
    <li><strong>P</strong> - Turn pencil on/off.</li>
    <li><strong>M</strong> - Change picture move mode. The mode
        is used while moving using <strong>I</strong>,<strong>K</strong>,<strong>J</strong>,<strong>L</strong>
        keys:<ul>
            <li><strong>Repeat</strong> - The edge of moved
                picture will be repeated.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll</strong> - The edge will be fillled
                with edge from the other side of moved picture.</li>
            <li><strong>Background</strong> - The edge will be
                filled with background color.</li>
            <li><strong>Foreground</strong> - The edge will be
                filled with foreground color.</li>
            <li><strong>Flip/Rotate</strong> - Flip or rotate
                instead of movement. Use keys as following:<ul>
                    <li><strong>I</strong> - Flip vertically.</li>
                    <li><strong>K</strong> - Flip horizontally.</li>
                    <li><strong>J</strong> - Rotate counter
                        clockwise - works only when width equals
                        to height.</li>
                    <li><strong>L</strong> - Rotate clockwise -
                        works only when width equals to height.</li>
                </ul>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>N</strong> - Invert colors between cursors.</li>
    <li><strong>C</strong> - Copy picture between cursors as text
        to clipboard. This function uses characters selected as
        foreground and background color in first paint
        configuration.</li>
    <li><strong>V</strong> - Paste picture between cursors from
        flipboard. The clipboard bust contain text using
        characters selected as foreground and background color in
        first paint configuration.</li>

<h3>Status bar</h3>

<p>In state 4, the status bar has different layout, described
from left to right:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Font and cursor size (width and height).</li>
    <li>Canvas cursor position and size in pixels. The size sign
        (plus or minus) indicates direction from main cursor to

<h3>Cursor display</h3>

<p>Console can display cursor over the character, not over the
pixel. If you select configuration with pixels smaller than
character, you will move pixel by pixel, when you press cursor
keys. The visible cursor will by over this character, which
contains pointed pixel. To point a specified pixel, you have to
observe the position on status bar or count movement from last
visible cursor movement.</p>

<p>To check position, you can draw pixel or other figure (key <strong>3</strong>,
<strong>4</strong>, <strong>5</strong>, <strong>6</strong>) and
undo the drawing by pressing <strong>Z</strong>.</p>
