<title>TextPaint - Animation player</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Animation player</h1>

<p><strong>TextPaint</strong> can handle ANSI escape codes, which
allows to get colored text using colors from palette of standard
16 items, which was used in DOS operating system and
ANSI-compatible text terminals like DEC VT100. In 1990s the ANSI
files was popular format of colorful ASCII-art, which was called
as ANSI-art.</p>

<p>Some ANSI files contains simple animation achieved by
manipulating cursor position and character writing out of the
line-by-line order. Such files was animated where was displayed
slowly. Most BBS and similar services provides about 2400 bits
per second.</p>

<p>The animation player allows to display any file using
sequentially displaying character to view simple ANSI animations
or graphics like while downoading in real time. After running the
animation player, you will see information about functions
available during displaying. At this state, you have two choices:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Press <strong>Enter</strong> key for select the file from
        file manager.</li>
    <li>Press <strong>Tab</strong> key for return to main menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can play the animation forward, backward or seek manually
by pressing appropiate keys.</p>

<p>You can use the following keys while animation display:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Escape</strong> or <strong>=</strong> - Return to
        information screen.</li>
    <li><strong>Tab</strong> - Show or hide status bar.</li>
    <li><strong>`</strong> - Change information displayed on the
        status bar.</li>
    <li><strong>Space</strong> - Show the file information
        including SAUCE. For return to player, you have to press
        one of the following keys: <strong>Space</strong>, <strong>Escape</strong>,
        <strong>Enter</strong>, <strong>Backspace</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Enter</strong> - Start or stop playing forward,
        according the FileDelaySteps and FileDelayTime
        parameters.</li>
    <li><strong>Backspace</strong> - Start or stop playing
        backward, according the FileDelaySteps and FileDelayTime
        parameters.</li>
    <li><strong>Up Arrow</strong> and <strong>Down Arrow</strong>
        - Move animation position by one step.</li>
    <li><strong>Left Arrow</strong> and <strong>Right Arrow</strong>
        - Move animation position by steps defined as
        FileDelaySteps.</li>
    <li><strong>Home</strong> - Move into animation begin.</li>
    <li><strong>End</strong> - Move into animation end.</li>
    <li><strong>]</strong> - Increase playing speed.</li>
    <li><strong>[</strong> - Decrease playing speed.</li>
    <li><strong>/</strong> - Reset playing speed.</li>
    <li><strong>Page Up</strong> or <strong>Page Down</strong> -
        Prowse for previous or next file.</li>
    <li><strong>,</strong> - Copy screen to clipboard.</li>
    <li><strong>\</strong> - ANSI processing parameters and
        display configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to exit to main menu, press the <strong>Escape</strong>
key to return to information and press <strong>Tab</strong> key
to exit.</p>

<h1>Mouse operation</h1>

<p>During animation display, you can use mouse for copy any
screen area into clipboard. The area will be rectangular between
mouse button press and release. The area will not be highlighted.</p>

<h1>Status bar</h1>

<p>During display, you can show or hide the status bar by
pressing <strong>Tab</strong> key, Using the the <strong>`</strong>
or <strong>~</strong> key you can switch between the five states.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>State 1</strong> (default) - Basic information
        about file and playback:<ul>
            <li>Position step and animation length.</li>
            <li>Four elements for help to distinguish animation
                and still image:<ul>
                    <li>Number of written characters.</li>
                    <li>Number of overwritten characters.</li>
                    <li>Number of insert/delete operations.</li>
                    <li>Number of scroll operations.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Current index number and number of all files
                followed by current file name. You can switch
                between files using <strong>Page Up</strong> and <strong>Page
                Down</strong> keys. The character separating the
                index number and file name has the following
                meaning:<ul>
                    <li><strong>Colon sign</strong> - The file
                        does not contain the SAUCE information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equation sign</strong> - The file
                        contains the SAUCE information, which can
                        be shown by pressing the <strong>Space</strong>
                        key.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Current speed change, 0 means default speed
                defined as FileDelayStep parameter. You can
                change the speed usin + and - keys.
                Alternatively, you can use the = and _ keys.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>State 2</strong> - Animation details:<ul>
            <li>Position step and animation length.</li>
            <li>Four elements for help to distinguish animation
                and still image:<ul>
                    <li>Number of written characters.</li>
                    <li>Number of overwritten characters.</li>
                    <li>Number of insert/delete operations.</li>
                    <li>Number of scroll operations.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Current animation speed:<ul>
                    <li><strong>0</strong> - Default speed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Positive number</strong> -
                        Increased speed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Negative number</strong> -
                        Decreased speed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Current animation speed as number of playback
                steps.</li>
            <li>Number of current step and minimum/maximum number
                of dummy steps added by <strong>1Bh [ 1 ; P1 V</strong>
                (time marker) sequence. The negative number
                means, that the time presented by time marker
                represents ealier number of steps. In such case,
                the display can be slightly glitched. You have to
                increase the <strong>PlayerDelayFrame</strong>
                parameter to solve this problem. If the time
                marker is not processed, there will be displayes
                two question marks.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>State 3</strong>, <strong>State 4</strong> and <strong>State
        5</strong> - the states allows to follow the character
        processing during playback:<ul>
            <li>Position step and animation length.</li>
            <li>Current character and animation character number
                (may vary depending on used codec).</li>
            <li>Several characters before and after current
                playback position, in this information there is
                difference between the three states:<ul>
                    <li><strong>State 3</strong> - Display
                        characters above <strong>0x1Fh</strong>
                        as characters and below <strong>0x20h</strong>
                        as numbers.</li>
                    <li><strong>State 4</strong> - Display
                        characters from <strong>0x21h</strong> to
                        <strong>0x7E</strong> as characters and
                        other characters as numbers.</li>
                    <li><strong>State 5</strong> - Display all
                        characters as numbers.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Every press Tab key forces screen to repaint, so if screens
displays glitches, press the <strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>`</strong>
or <strong>~</strong> key to repaint.</p>

<h1>Animation versus still picture</h1>

<p>The most ANSI files can be classified into three categories:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Still picture, which size is in the screen size (usually
        80x24 or 80x25).</li>
    <li>Still picture, which size exceedes the screen size
        vertically (at the end of play, the bottom part is
        visible).</li>
    <li>Animation created using ANSI/VTxxx commands.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no way to distinguisg there types, but animation
player counts some operations, which allows to suppose (but
without sure), what is the file kind:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Character writes</strong> - All characters writes
        during animation playback.</li>
    <li><strong>Character overwrites</strong> - Occurs very
        frequently in animations, but rather not occurs in still
        pictures. The character write will be classified as
        overwrite, where meets at least one of following
        conditions when comparing to previous character in the
        same place (the font attribues such as bold or underline
        are treated as foreground color):<ul>
            <li>Previous character is not a space and next
                character is different to previous character.</li>
            <li>Previous character is not a space and the
                foreground color is not a default color and the
                next foreground color is different to previous
                color.</li>
            <li>The background color is not a default color and
                the next background color is different to
                previous color.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Insert and delete characters</strong> - May occur
        in some VTxxx animations. There are counting the
        following commands:<ul>
            <li><strong>SR</strong>, <strong>SL</strong> -
                counted twice (there is combination of insert and
                delete), multiplied by number of affected text
                lines.</li>
            <li><strong>DECBI</strong>, <strong>DECFI</strong>, <strong>ICH</strong>,
                <strong>DCH</strong> - counted as single
                operation.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Scroll action</strong> - Every scroll action (up
        or down) caused by appropriate character or command.
        Still picture exceeding the screen size will cause many
        scroll actions.</li>
</ul>
